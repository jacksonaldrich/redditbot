# redditbot (project_04) IN PROGRESS
This is the GitHub repository for the project_04 (RedditBot). The The `bot.py` file contains a program that has a Reddit bot post comments (generated using either a madlib technique) in support of politicians Obama, Hillary, and Biden. The name of my bot is "notapythonbot".
Every time that any of my bots ran into a ratelimit longer than 5 minutes, I would make the `bot.py` file call a function in the `bot_counter` file that tabulated the number of valid posts that that bot has made and delete any invalid posts.

My score on this project should be X/30. I completed all of the tasks in `bot.py`, which are worth a total of 12 points. I also completed the GitHub repository, which is worth 3 points (completed all of the requirements). "notapythonbot" posted 1000 valid comments, which is worth 10 points.


**Optional Tasks**



Output of `bot_counter.py` file:
```
len(comments)= 1000
len(top_level_comments)= X
len(replies)= X
len(valid_top_level_comments)= X
len(not_self_replies)= X
len(valid_replies)= X
========================================
valid_comments= 1000
